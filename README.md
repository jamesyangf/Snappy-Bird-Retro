## About

This is a Flappy Bird Spin Off game that I made with different assets. 
Just tap the screen to start moving the bird up and stop tapping it to let if fall to gravity.
If you hit a obstacle you will lose. 
Tap the screen again to restart.

I want to make this game as unique as possible and will
be providing even more features to the game in the future!
